# Progress Log

## Session 1: Initial Build & Core Experience
- **Environment Setup:** Initialized Vite + React project with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.
- **Visual System:** Implemented "Horizon" (sky/sea gradient) and "MedinaLayers" (parallax architecture) components.
- **Audio System:** Built a Web Audio API engine (`src/audio`) for procedural Wind, Sea, and Ferry Horn sounds, modulated by scroll position.
- **Narrative Engine:** Created `NarrativeOverlay` to sequence text fragments based on scroll depth, following the PRD's pacing.
- **Interaction:** Implemented scroll-based progression to drive both visual and audio changes.
- **Verification:** Verified frontend rendering and ensuring no visible UI chrome or loading states.

**Current Completion:** ~90%
- Core experience is functional.
- Audio and Visuals are implemented procedurally.
- Pending: Fine-tuning of audio textures (footsteps) and more detailed architectural assets if needed.
