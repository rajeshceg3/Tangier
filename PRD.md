Tangier, Morocco — The Threshold Between Worlds


---

THE PRESENCE ARCHITECTURE PROMPT

(For Designing the Definitive Web-Based Immersive Experience of Tangier, Morocco)


---

CORE DIRECTIVE

Design a web-based experience that does not describe Tangier —
it must embody it.

This is not tourism software.
This is a digital threshold.

The user should feel:

The pull between Africa and Europe

The slow drift of salt air

The hush before the ferry horn

The weight of layered histories pressing quietly into stone


Presence is the product.


---

PHASE I — FIRST PRINCIPLES EXTRACTION (MANDATORY)

Before interface decisions, determine:

1. Scale

Tangier is edge-scale.
Not vast like a desert.
Not intimate like a room.
It is a threshold city — perched, layered, descending toward water.

It is:

Vertical (Kasbah to port)

Sloping

Wind-open

Horizon-facing


2. Tempo

Time in Tangier is:

Unhurried

Suspended between departures

Wind-driven

Afternoon-heavy


There is anticipation, but no urgency.

3. Emotional Core

Standing alone in Tangier, one feels:

Between worlds

Slightly untethered

Small before the Strait

Calm, but alert


It is not loud wonder.
It is quiet crossing.

4. Silence

What matters most is what is absent:

No constant traffic roar

No relentless city hum

No compression


Instead:

Wind

Distant gulls

Occasional call to prayer

The echo of footsteps in stone alleys


Silence is spatial.

All interface decisions must derive from these truths.

EXPERIENCE STRUCTURE

1. Arrival — The Horizon

Begin in near-emptiness.

The screen opens to:

A pale sky

A distant line of sea

Slow, directional wind audio

No visible interface


No instructions.
No title.

Only after stillness does the land gradually emerge —
the white architecture of the medina descending.

Nothing moves quickly.

Loading is disguised as light gathering.


---

2. Orientation — Understanding Edge and Elevation

Users do not “navigate.”
They drift downward.

Movement mimics:

Human walking pace

Subtle incline

Slight parallax shift between buildings and sea


No minimap.
No compass.

Instead:

The horizon remains stable

The sound of water grows subtly louder as one descends


UI elements appear only when the user pauses.


---

3. Exploration — The Medina as Breathing Space

Movement slows inside the medina.

Narrower visual field

Light compresses

Sound becomes textured (footsteps, wind through gaps)


Text does not pop up.

Instead:

A faint line of typography fades near architectural surfaces

Information reveals only when the user lingers


Facts are secondary to atmosphere.


---

4. Discovery — Layers of History

Tangier is not one era.

It has passed through:

Phoenician traders

Roman presence

Portuguese fortification

International Zone intrigue


But history must never appear as a timeline.

Instead:

Architecture subtly shifts tone

Text appears like marginalia in a traveler’s notebook

Fragments, not lectures


Let users sense layered time.


---

5. The Strait — Confronting the Threshold

Eventually, the user reaches the overlook.

The sea fills more of the screen.

Wind intensifies slightly.

Europe is only implied — never labeled.

At this moment:

No text.

Just horizon.

Hold stillness.

Reflection is not prompted.
It is allowed.


---

VISUAL LANGUAGE SYSTEM

Color Palette

Extracted from Tangier itself:

Chalk white (sun-washed walls)

Muted indigo (doors, shadows)

Sandstone beige

Pale Atlantic blue

Soft dusk amber


No saturated modern tones.


---

Typography

Humanist sans-serif

Light weight

Wide letter spacing

Breath between lines


Text should feel like wind passing, not narration.


---

Geometry

No hard boxes.

Soft-edged overlays

Gradual fades

Panels that feel like light, not containers


The interface must feel carved from brightness and air.


---

MOTION PRINCIPLES

No looping animations

No bouncing elements

No kinetic spectacle


All motion must:

Ease in naturally

Reflect walking cadence

Follow gravity or wind direction


Micro-interactions should feel like:

The city acknowledging your presence —
not reacting to clicks.


---

AUDIO DESIGN

Soundscape layers:

1. Directional wind


2. Distant gulls


3. Occasional ferry horn


4. Faint, distant call to prayer



No background music by default.

Silence must dominate.

Audio changes subtly based on:

Elevation

Openness

Proximity to water



---

TECHNICAL PRINCIPLES (IMPLICIT)

No visible loading states

No spinners

No dashboards

No UI chrome


Transitions must feel continuous.

Performance must feel inevitable.


---

WHAT TO REMOVE

Remove:

Gamification

Achievement markers

Over-explanation

Maps

Tooltips

Excessive color contrast

Dramatic cinematic effects


If it feels impressive, it is likely too loud.


---

FINAL VALIDATION TEST

Ask internally:

If someone experiences this web application
and later visits Tangier in person,

would they feel an eerie familiarity —
as though they had already stood in that wind?

If not:

Remove more.

Simplify further.

Let air return.
